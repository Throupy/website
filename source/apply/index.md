## What is CADS?

CADS is a club held at the Chase every Monday from 3:30 pm to 4:30 pm. Meetings range from learning about different cyber tools to building on key skills such as public speaking, CV writing, etc... _Lots of our meetings last year are summarised in our_ [_blog_](/archives)_._

## Why apply?

CADS can help you improve both key life skills (e.g. public speaking, CV writing, presentation skills) and also cyber and computing based skills (e.g. advanced Google searching, OSINT). It is also a great to write on a CV to show that you have been actively learning new skills outside of normal school.

If you'd like to get more information, try and find a Year 13 student at lunchtime to talk to.

CyberCenturion is a cyber security competition run by Cyber Security Challenge UK that is open to 12 to 18 year olds in the UK. Teams participate in various rounds, attempting to discover all the security vulnerabilities within numerous installations of Windows and Ubuntu operating systems. Teams gain points by securing their systems, however ill-fated changes or reduction in security can cause the undesired loss of points.

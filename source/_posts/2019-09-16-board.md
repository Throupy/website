This week, we didn't have many people attend so we didn't want to do anything big. We decided to refresh an 4-5 year old CADS display board at school and update it with some newer content. We also talked more about the application process and which days we were going to setup a stand in our Sixth Form block to tell students about CADS and hand out forms.

This week, we were split into two teams again, one of the teams finished up work on the board which is going to show people at our school about what CADS does with some posters and other things about how to stay safe online.

The other half of us (which were just the older ones) were tasked with thinking of two sessions to teach next year. We decided on a session introducing basic Linux skills such as command line and other Linux knowledge. The other session, we wanted to talk about the dark web, as it was one of our favourite sessions last year. We split up into 2 more teams and each team worked on one of these sessions. We'll update you later on about how this goes!

That's the last session for this year now, see you in 2020!

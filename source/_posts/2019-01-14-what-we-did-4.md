This week we finalised our assembly presentation, ready to get checked over by our deputy head.

After doing a practice of the presentation with the 3 speakers that will be presenting the assembly and everyone else watching, we got some valuable feedback on how to improve the presentation ready for our first real assembly on the 25th January.

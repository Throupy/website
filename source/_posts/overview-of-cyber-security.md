Overview of Cyber Security - Talk by Cam Lewis         10/02/20

This week Cam did a talk on what cyber security actually is. he started off with anecdote highlighting the differences between society with a picture of an internet cafe alongside a horse and carriage. This illustrated that in the modern day world cyber and the internet is everywhere.

Integrity is about protection and so information can't be altered by outside sources. Availability means that the data isn't locked down to the point that no one can access it.

A difficult tactic to defend against is internal intrusion.

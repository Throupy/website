This week we were talking about some of the consequences of major businesses in the UK not having internet.

We looked at a range of companies from The Co-op to The NHS and tried to find out what would be some of the most important things that they might lose without internet.

For example:
* The Co-op might not be able to order in stock without internet and might not be able to do home deliveries, etc..
* The NHS might not be able to share patient information between different hospitals, etc..

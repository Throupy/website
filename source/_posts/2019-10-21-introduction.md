This week was the first meeting with our new CADS members. We started off with a little summary of what CADS is, who runs it and what kind of things we would get up to in the next month or so.

Each of the new members was paired with an older member and then we needed to find out about each other: full name; backstory; which A Levels they are doing and why; interesting facts; embarrassing moments and their claim to fame. After that, we took it in turns to tell everyone else what we had found out about our pair. This was a pretty fun way to get to know all of the new members.

Next week, we will be doing a workshop-style meeting and also in a couple of weeks, there are the practice rounds of [CyberCenturion](/cybercenturion) which we plan to have 4 teams participating in.

This week we were planning ideas for things that we could take and show at an upcoming local career fair. We are promoting cyber security jobs and plan to show off some real world examples of what a cyber security job might entail.

At the end of the session we ended up deciding on taking a look at showing off Wireshark, Password Cracking and Encryption. We also decided on what times people are going to man the stand.
